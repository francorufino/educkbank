      <h3>1. Duckling Card:</h3>
      <p>
        For our little ducklings taking their first paddles into the pond of
        finance, we present the Duckling Card! With no annual fee, this card is
        specifically designed for children aged 10 to 17, offering parental
        controls and spending limits to ensure a safe and educational banking
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wait, there's a quacking good bonus! When a child spends only 1/3 of
        the card limit and pays off their balance on the due date, they earn
        tokens that are added to their savings account. It's a delightful way to
        encourage responsible spending and nest egg building from an early age.
      </p>
