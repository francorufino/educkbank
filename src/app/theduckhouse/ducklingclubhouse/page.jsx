        Welcome to the Duckling Savings Clubhouse – where young savers embark on
        a quack-tastic journey where saving money is not just about piggy banks
        – it's an exciting journey packed with valuable lessons and rewarding
        experiences!
      </p>
      <h2>What Is It?</h2>
      <p>
        Our clubhouse is all about arts and crafts; financial empowerment,
        creativity, coding, and community engagement. Designed for children from
        7 to 17 years old, the Duckling Savings Clubhouse offers a variety of
        classes to enhance their financial literacy, creativity, and coding
        skills. Here are some of the classes we offer:
      </p>
      <h2>Classes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Money Masterclass:</strong> Participants dive into the world
          of finance with our Money Masterclass, where kids learn the basics of
          budgeting, saving, and smart spending through engaging activities and
          games.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Art of Saving:</strong> They get creative with their savings
          goals in our Art of Saving class! Kids explore the connection between
          art and money management as they design vision boards and create
          savings jars to visualize their financial dreams.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Excel Explorers:</strong> They unlock the power of
          spreadsheets in our Excel Explorers class! Kids learn essential Excel
          skills like creating budgets, tracking expenses, and analyzing savings
          goals in a hands-on, interactive workshop. Once they master basic
          formulas and navigation, they can advance to coding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coding for Kids:</strong> Kids start their coding journey in
          our Coding for Kids class! Kids learn basic to intermediate coding
          skills to build programs that control their finances. They start by
          applying their Excel knowledge and progress to creating interactive
          financial management tools using coding languages like Python and
          JavaScript. They'll also learn HTML and CSS to translate their
          artistic creations learnt in the Art and Design Classes into their own
          web pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Art, Design and Design Thinking:</strong> Exploring the
          intersection of art, design, and finance in our Art and Design
          Thinking class! Kids unleash their creativity as they develop
          innovative solutions to financial challenges through art and design
          projects. As they advance, they utilize advanced design software like
          Photoshop and Illustrator to give their creations a professional
          touch.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to these classes, we empower kids to utilize their newfound
        skills for altruistic endeavors. They are encouraged to create simple
        designs and landing pages for charities and small businesses dedicated
        to helping others. We advocate for a balanced approach: while we suggest
        charging for some of their work, we also encourage them to offer their
        services pro bono, allowing them to experience both the financial and
        altruistic aspects of their talents. This dual approach fosters a deeper
        understanding of the value of their skills and the impact they can make
        on their community.
      </p>
      <p>
        By engaging in these projects, kids not only contribute to meaningful
        causes but also build their own portfolio of work. As they compile their
        designs and creations, they develop a tangible representation of their
        abilities. This portfolio becomes a valuable asset as they progress
        through their educational and professional journey, providing them with
        a strong foundation and a wealth of experience to draw upon as they
        pursue their career aspirations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our classes are designed with flexibility in mind, taking into
        consideration both students' and parents' schedules. Held semesterly
        with winter and spring breaks, our sessions offer two convenient time
        slots: Saturdays from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm or from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm.
        This allows parents to choose the time that best aligns with their
        family's commitments and activities. Whether they prefer to start their
        day with early morning classes or enjoy afternoons filled with learning
        and creativity, our schedule ensures that both students and parents can
        participate without conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Duckling Savings Clubhouse, we're not just focused on financial
        success; we also care deeply about the future well-being of our young
        savers and the community as a whole. We believe that by empowering kids
        with the skills to manage their money responsibly and contribute
        positively to society, we can create a brighter future for everyone.
